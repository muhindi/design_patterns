Structural Design Patterns
Prescribe the organization of classes and objects. The patterns are concerned with how classes inherit
from each other or are composed from other classes.
Adapter, Proxy and Decorator: Introduce indirection between client class and class it wants to use.
Adapter: Uses indirection to modify the interface of a class to make it easier for a client class to use it.
Decorator: Uses indirection to add behavior to a class, without affecting the client class
Proxy: Uses indirection to transparently provide a stand-in for another class.
